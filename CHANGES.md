- Seamless mode switching

### 4. Enhanced UI
- Mode indicator in header
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Toast notifications for operations
- Disabled states for unavailable actions

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Compatibility
- Changed from CUDA to CPU for embeddings (better compatibility)
- No GPU requirement

### 2. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when vector store is missing
- Better error messages for users
- Try-catch blocks for file operations

### 3. Code Organization
- Separated concerns (upload, chat, document management)
- Reusable functions
- Clear configuration variables

## Usage Instructions
