Unlike CPUs, GPUs are highly optimized for this purpose and can process these types of tasks much faster than your CPU. They're typically found in gaming PCs, laptops, and other devices that require high visual quality performance. Essentially, a GPU is a specialized chip designed to help your computer generate the visuals you see on your screen, making it an essential component for graphics-heavy activities like video games or creating 3D models.",

Think of it as the main controller, taking in information from the RAM (Random Access Memory) and other components to perform tasks such as running software applications, handling input/output operations, and managing system processes.\n\nIn essence, without a CPU, your computer wouldn't be able to do much, or even turn on!",
